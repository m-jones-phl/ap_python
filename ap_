# 1. Describe what a computer program is and what does it do. 

# A computer program is a operation made by the user for the computer to run.

# 2. Describe what complexitity and abstraction are, then provide an example
# of complexity in the real world and how we apply abstraction to that thing (you example must be original and cannot be an example
# used in our lecture slides ie car, grocery store, etc.). 

# complexitity are complex problem that take a lot of time and energy to perform.
#example solving a rubic cube

# abstraction: The process of removing a piece of something in order to reduce it to a certain performance level.
# example: fixing your car

# A complexitity problem is trying to organize your house, and abstraction can help on with to keep and 
# throw away.
  
# 3. What is Syntax in Python and why is it important to write proper syntax?

# The syntax in python is a programming language that is a set of rules that defines how a python program
# is written and perceived

# 4. What is a function, and why do we wrap our code inside of functions?

#A function is a block of code,  we wrap it in code to give it instructions so it can perform it task.

# 5. Name and describe the three  (3) naming conventions for variables in python? Then provide three (3) name rules for Python
# variables. 

# Blade, Fire, Dragon, These are three variable names that follow the rules of no number, 
# no symbols start the name variable , and variable are case senstive


# 6. What will be the output of the print functons when this code is ran, explain why
name = 'Bill
student = name
name = 'Walter'
student= 'Richard'

print(name)
print(student)

'Nothing happen but errors because Bill isnt put in a proper string one of the "" is gone so it wont run'

# 7. Describe the difference between each of the following name assignment operators:

# =- used to assign a value to a variable 
# == - used to compare vaules or equailty two values 
# != - used to show if it not equal to the operator
 

# 8. What type of data can be stored in a python list?

# the data is usually int, float

# 9. Create a function that will take in a word provided by a user and then output that word back to the user but in reverse. 

Fire = "Exsposion inter blade"[::-1]
print(Fire)

# 10. Create three (3) seperate functions that will do addition, subtraction, and multiplication respectively. 
# each of these functions should take two (2) arguments. When the user passes these arguments into the function, they will be
# calculated together and return the output in your terminal.
 
x = input('Put in a number')
y = input('Put in another number')
print(x+y)  

a = input('Put in a number')
z = input('Put in another number')
print(a-z)

h = input('Put in a number')
q = input('Put in another number')
print(h*y)

# 11. What is the difference between a function argument and a function parameter. 

# A function argument, is an argument passing throw some code, a parameter are names listed in a function
# defintion.

# 12. You have been hired by a software company and your first assignment is to develop a password authenticator program. 
# the goal of your program is to check a user's password and make sure it meets the company's password requirements. 
# the company has provided you with the following requirements for the passcode program:
# a. the passcode must NOT contain any numbers
# b. the passcode must NOT contain any capital letters
# c. the passcode can NOT be any longer than five (5) characters
# d. the passcode can NOT shorter the three (3) characters
# e. the user should be able to enter their password and if it meets the requirements, should print a message saying that 
# their password was created successfully, and if it was not, should send back a message with one of the following issues. 

def store():
    code = input('What is the password')
    if code == 'plane':
        print(' their password was created successfully')
    else:
        print('Wrong pass word')
store()    

# 13. When you run your code and see typeError in your terminal, what does that typically mean and how would you try to solve
# the issue?

# TypeError on your terminal means that the way you wrote your code is not right, or there a problems.
# The way to fix said problem is to check the terminal and say which line is causing the problem, the 
# terminal will usually tell you.

# 14. When you run your code and see indentError in your terminal, what does that typically mean and how would you try to solve 
# the issue?

# IndentError in your terminal mean the you forgot to tab something on your code, fixin just have to see 
# which line the terminal tells you it happen and fix it.

# 15. Create a while loop that check a user's password. If they enter the password correct, they will get a message saying 
# that the password was entered successfully. If they enter the password incorrectly, it will tell the user to try again. 
# The user should only have three (3) attempts to get the password correct. If they enter the password incorrect on the fourth 
# attempt, a message should appear telling them that have been locked out and need to talk to the administrator. 

def secert():
    past =('What is the password') 
    if past == 'PLanet':
        print('succesfully')
l = 1
while l < 4:
  print(l)
  l += 1
else:
        print('Incorrect, try around')

secert()

# 16. Which item is at index 5
giftShopping=['xbox','sneakers','necklace','clothing','laptop','gift card']

# Gift card is five

# 17. Create a for loop that will print ONLY the even numbers within the range of the variable provided below.
# HINT: You will need to use the range() function. 
upToNumber = 30

upToNumver = range(30)
for b in upToNumver:
  print(b)


# 18. Create a function that uses a conditional statement that checks if a person qualifies for a raise on their salary. 
# The user should be able to enter their name, their salary (how much money they make in an entire year), and how long they have
# worked at the company. If the user has been working at the company longer than four (4) years, they will get a 15% raise. 
# Your program should be able to calculate what their salary is with the 15% increase. If the user qualifies, your program
# should return the a message congratulating the user by name, and telling them what their new salary is with the 15%
# increase (this must be the actual number). If they do not qualify inform the user that unfortunately they do not qualify. 

def work():
    name =('What is your name?')
    salary =('how much money do you make a year?')
    company =('how long have you been a in the company')
    if salary == + 4:
        print = salary*15
    elif == - 4: print('No salary increase')

work()

# 19. Create a function that checks which value is greater than the other. Your function should take two (2) integer parameters. 
# and should evaluate which number is larger. Your function should then print the largest number. 

Great = input('Put in a number')
good = input('put a number')
print(max(Great, good))
# 20. Create a while loop function that will add gift items to a list. Your function should ask the user to enter an item name. 
# The item name should then be added to a list variable called gift_bag. Your gift bag should have a limit of six (6) items. 
# Once your gift bag hits its limit of six (6) items your program should print a message saying 
# that the gift bag is full and print the list of items in the gift bag.   
 
def births()
birth = ['cake', 'pizza', 'cards']
while birth < 4:
  print(birth)
  birth += 1
more = input(birth, 'would you like anythin more?')
